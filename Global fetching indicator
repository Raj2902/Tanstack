Displaying Global Background Fetching Loading State
In addition to individual query loading states, if you would like to show a global loading indicator when any queries are fetching (including in the background), you can use the useIsFetching hook:

import { injectIsFetching } from '@tanstack/angular-query-experimental'

@Component({
  selector: 'global-loading-indicator',
  template: `
    @if (isFetching()) {
      <div>Queries are fetching in the background...</div>
    }
  `,
})
export class GlobalLoadingIndicatorComponent {
  isFetching = injectIsFetching()
}
