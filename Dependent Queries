Dependent Queries
injectQuery dependent Query
Dependent (or serial) queries depend on previous ones to finish before they can execute. To achieve this, it's as easy as using the enabled option to tell a query when it is ready to run:

// Get the user
userQuery = injectQuery(() => ({
  queryKey: ['user', email],
  queryFn: getUserByEmail,
}))

// Then get the user's projects
projectsQuery = injectQuery(() => ({
  queryKey: ['projects', this.userQuery.data()?.id],
  queryFn: getProjectsByUser,
  // The query will not execute until the user id exists
  enabled: !!this.userQuery.data()?.id,
}))

Practise question :
1) Fetch product list from an api using injectQueries and using the productId gets its avalibity using another dependent Query?
