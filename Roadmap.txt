We'll go step by step, covering everything from the basics to advanced use cases. Here's the roadmap I'll follow:

### **Step 1: Understanding the Basics**
- What is TanStack Query?
- Why use it in Angular?
- Installing TanStack Query in an Angular project

### **Step 2: Fetching Data**
- Using `fetchQuery` and `injectQuery` in Angular
- Handling loading, error, and success states
- Caching and automatic refetching

### **Step 3: Mutating Data**
- Using `injectMutation` for POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Handling optimistic updates
- Error handling and rollback strategies

### **Step 4: Advanced Query Features**
- Query invalidation and refetching
- Pagination and infinite scrolling
- Dependent queries (chained API calls)

### **Step 5: Optimizing Performance**
- Prefetching data
- Background updates
- Query retries and exponential backoff

### **Step 6: Real-World Project**
- Integrating TanStack Query with JSON Server
- Building a complete Angular app with caching, optimistic updates, and pagination
- Best practices and debugging

I'll explain concepts with examples and code snippets. Do you want to start with **what TanStack Query is and why you should use it in Angular?** ðŸš€
