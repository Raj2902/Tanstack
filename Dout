1) What is background synchronization and how to implement it in angular using tanstack query?
2)When use fetchQuery and when use injectQuery, whats the diffrence??
Ans : fetchQuery is use to fetch data from api but we need to manually handle data, loading and error.
injectQuery : Also use for fetch data from api but handles data, loading and error automatically.
3)Is using fetchQuery for single data call in dynamic routing is the right thing to do or not??
4)Where to use tanstack query in the services or in the component.ts offical docs used them inside component.ts while project used it inside services??
